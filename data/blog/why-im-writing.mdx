I've been meaning to start a blog for a while. The excuses were numerous: no time, nothing novel to say, no perfect platform. All bad reasons to stay quiet.

The real reason I didn't write publicly was fear — fear of being wrong, of sounding stupid, of committing ideas to the permanent record. But that's exactly backwards. Writing is how you find out what you actually think. Keeping ideas in your head is how they stay vague and half-formed forever.

So here we are.

## What this is

This is a place for me to think out loud. Primarily about:

- **AI and what it changes.** Not predictions — I'm skeptical of anyone who tells you with confidence how this plays out. But I'm interested in what's actually changing in how people work, build, and think.
- **Building things.** I build software. I'll write about specific projects, technical decisions, and what I'm learning as I go.
- **Ideas that are worth taking seriously.** Economics, epistemology, how institutions change, why some ideas spread and others don't.

It won't be polished. I'd rather publish something rough and real than wait until it's perfect enough that I never ship it.

## What this isn't

This isn't a newsletter (no subscription required, no growth goals), not a portfolio (though projects will be here), not a hot-takes machine. I'm not writing to build an audience — I'm writing to think.

If you find something useful here, good. If you want to disagree, better. The only failure mode is saying nothing.
