Speed-reading is the wrong optimization. The goal isn't to maximize books read — it's to let ideas metabolize.

I've started keeping a single book on my desk and one for travel. Nothing else in progress. The result is that I actually remember what I read.

There's a related thing: finishing bad books is also the wrong optimization. Life is short. If a book isn't worth reading slowly, abandon it without guilt.

The books worth reading are worth reading twice.
